# HTTP-server-in-C
my first proper project which I really like??
i don't really know how I plan to build this whole thing but I do have an idea of it, I'll pull this off in a week or smth and I don't really have a proper step by step plan
but i'll figure it out on the way, I do know what a web server is i just don't know how exactly I can write it in C since this is my first time using C
I'll be referencing blogs and manuals to build this btw :D i'll update this as soon as I have a plan on how to tackle this but initially this is the plan
